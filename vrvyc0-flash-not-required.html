                            <p> I was on YouTube, clicked on a video and it said what my title says. Only for this video though. I did what it said, t told me to download and install the flash player and it still didn't work. Help? Thanks. Thank you beautiful people of Redditside for all attention and so many reported problems, it's great help to our beloved game and community! We officially reached 200 (more or less) unique bugs recorded!. I'm still checking inbox, so feel free to report new findings IF YOU POSTED ALREADY AND FOUND MORE BUGS, POST IT AS NEW MESSAGE, DON'T EDIT YOUR CURRENT MESSAGES AS I WON'T SEE EDIT IN INBOX AFTER REFRESH! I APPRECIATE AS MANY DETAILS AS POSSIBLE, AS IT HELPS WITH CHECKING WHETHER. Via the CS:GO blog (https://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2019/03/23488/): # GAMEPLAY Adjusted round loss bonuses with the goal of reducing a negative feedback loop following streaks of losses. - Round loss bonuses are now based on the count of a team’s round losses.

A/N: So, here is Episode 4! In this episode, Michaels bumps elbows with the higher-ups, and we learn the U.S. battle plan. Not a very exciting post, but you get some character background, and a few key elements are laid out or set in motion. This episode could probably use another editorial pass, but so could the last three episodes. I'm also going to be real busy the next couple days, and I wanted to be able to work on Episode 5 over the weekend, which jumps back to Bradford's perspective Before we get started, this is an attempt to digest the Nightmare Cup Meta in a way that is not overly complicated but can give you a good idea of how the best Pokémon in Nightmare Cup stack up against each other. By nature, the simplification does omit certain “checks” and Pokémon that may counter these meta picks. In the past, we’ve omitted most checks; however, due to the Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) relationship of Nightmare, we decided to include checks within the individual groups Today, after 49 days, I finally finished reading and studying the amazing Le Petit Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. I wanted to share my specific approach to reading and learning from novels. I made a video discussing my experience reading Le Petit Prince (linked below), but if you'd prefer to just read my presentation slides, they are down below for your convenience. Let me know what you think and if you plan to try it. Happy studying! How to use Le Petit Prince to learn French: There's a rather old part of the plant where they used a triple pump config in serial to maintain high pressure fluid flow. All three pumps date from before 1980s. There was a second, much newer pump, also doing the same workload, but that one had bearing failure and thus was down. A few machines were put in standby mode to ensure others would have the necessary coolant flow. So one day the 1st old pump in the serial config had some sort of impeller failure. The other two pumps 
# Introduction amp#x200B; So if you've been browsing through this particular subreddit you will notice many people complaining about skill builds and how lackluster they are. Yes, they are lackluster if you're playing the build and expect to DPS down a juggernaut as fast as a build centered around weapons. However, if you took a different approach and made it so that you're relying on AOE/CC then it's actually a very strong and effective playstyle. Originally my build had 90% CDR + 900 Skill. Spacious skies. Amber waves of grain. Purple mountain majesties. America. America. God shed his grace. sigh and I shed my soul for thee. I eat alone, even when surrounded by others. I see the looks they give me sometimes. Even Kelso betrays a stray glance of concern. or is it doubt? I overheard some of the techs talking at mess. Someone asked what they missed most from before the Dollar Flu hit. Internet porn, ice cream, reality TV, sports, shopping. Trivial things And before you just go "Pft probably some gold/plat idiot trying to be hipster", let me show you the result of me climbing with her. I just reached Commander V from locking her and showing off my win rate so people are convinced to give me the mid position. https://i.imgur.com/JuFraLU.jpg (https://i.imgur.com/JuFraLU.jpg) And here are some of my recent matches. https://i.imgur.com/Hz6Gr75.jpg (https://i.imgur.com/Hz6Gr75.jpg) I play her in both Solo and Duo/Trio. Can't do much about. :)) Spelled AQW wrong in the post name. Sorry about that! amp#x200B; Hi everyone, I've recently got back into AQW after about a 6 year or more break and decided to create a new account and really play the game every day. I bought a 12 month membership day 1, then I purchased some ACs and got to questing, farming etc. Managed to beat the main storyline and working now on finishing the QoM saga and farming some cool items. After about 24 days I realized that the only reason I was still. Please post your findings here, I will try to update list with content from comments few times a day. Edit: Each issue has nickname of person reporting it in case somebody want to ask that person for more details. Also, credits. In case of more than one nick, first person usually was first one to report, followed by someone who provided more details/evidence. So far: 1. Some MAX weapons are attached to elbows, not hands.

In other Apple I am back and this is the first post of a new short series It occured to me that things like 'The Zone' and attention splitting as well as crowd science is super weird, So I am exploring that in a handful of shorts. amp#x200B; Stay tuned for more and an update about Back t o Human is at the bottom \_\_\_ amp#x200B; Human mental processes: 1 Flow and triggered unity amp#x200B; Report transcript from DR. K'ront, lead Behavioral scientist for the Galactic Community Sciences Collectiv. I suck at making intros, so I don’´t have a YouTube career, but I have put together some info on the Kollector’s shop for all of you guys. I’ll try to keep the fluff short and to the point. I’m also not putting K in every word with a C. Ok, maybe in a few words. Keep it kasual. Hope you enjoy. The Shop It’s in the Krypt.
