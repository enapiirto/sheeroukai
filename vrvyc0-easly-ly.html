Have to mention that english isn't my native language. So im really sorry for any mistakes. 1. Use of it. Im playing path of exile since nemesis league. Every time they did add a new league people were complaint about that. Only before the breach and in breach only 1% of people didn't liked it. (im gonna write down below more about breach) But when they did add something it had to bring something to the core. And game had to move with that idea. (example: almost every league is core mechanic.

First of all, I want to say that this article coused more pain to me than I would ever expected. It's not just a missconception, not even a falshood rant, it's outrageous lie.

Lets start by saying i'm a support player with a lot of diamond supports and hundreds of ranked support games. Cabrakan is a god which has seen almost 0 play as a support why is this? because i look at his kit and it just screams out support.
